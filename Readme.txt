# adblock.sh #
The adblock.sh script can find the IP adressess  (IPv4) of the domainNames given and uses them to make rules for the iptables.
I also can save or load rules from a file or print the rules that our system has or reset the rules so everything will be accepted.

# Does it work? #
Yes, if the address of the domain is IPv4 and if the ad that we want to block is in the iptable.
